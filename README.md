# Beta-VAE Experiment for HDARTS

Run code:
```
python3 train.py
```

- Swap out HDARTS and DARTS in models.py to try the two different models. 

- Results for entanglement written to csv.

- Only tricky part in generating the models is ensuring that the number of channels in and out for every operation works out correctly.
